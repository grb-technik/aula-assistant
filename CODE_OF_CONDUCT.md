# Code of Conduct

1. Be friendly and welcoming. Thereâ€™s no need to be mean or rude.
2. Be patient.
3. Be thoughtful. Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
4. Respect that people have a different opinion. There is seldom one right answer.
5. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
6. Any spamming, trolling, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

Inspired by the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) and the [Go Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct).
